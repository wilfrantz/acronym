	API :
 		Application programming interfaces.
		Web APIs are application interfaces intended for use not by humans but by software agents.
		They’re only “APIs” because the client and server have agreed, by convention, that certain 
		URLs and verbs have specific meanings and effects within the domain of their interaction.
