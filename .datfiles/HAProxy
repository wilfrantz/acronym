	HAPROXY :
			HAProxy is the most widely used open source load-balancing software.
			It proxies HTTP and TCP, supports sticky sessions to pin a given client 
			to a specific web server, and offers advanced health-checking capabilities.
			HAProxy’s configuration is usually contained in a single file, haproxy.cfg.
