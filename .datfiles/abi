	ABI :
 		Application Binary Interface.
		Every library or framework, regardless of the technologies or the programming 
		language used, exposes a set of certain functionalities, which is known as
		its Application Programming Interface (API)

		While the API guarantees the compatibility of two software components to 
		continue their functional cooperation, the ABI guarantees that two programs 
		are compatible at the level of their machine-level instructions, together 
		with their corresponding object files
