	AST :
		Abstract Syntax Tree.
		gcc (or any other C compiler) splits the mission into two steps,
		first parsing the translation unit into an relocatable and 
		C-independent data structure called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST),
		and then using the created AST to generate the equivalent assembly
		instructions for the target architecture.
