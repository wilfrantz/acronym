LLVM :
		Low Level Virtual Machine.
		Collection of compilers for many languages beyond C and C++
		such as Java, Fortran. Ex. Clang.

		The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project uses an intermediate 
		representation – or LLVM IR – as its abstract data structure used 
		between its frontend and its backend. LLVM is famous for its ability 
		to dump its IR data structure for research purposes.
