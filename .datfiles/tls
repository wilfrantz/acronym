	TLS :
 		Transport Layer Security. 
		Its now-deprecated predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic
		protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network.

		Several versions of the protocols find widespread use in applications such as 
		web browsing, email, instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). 
		Websites can use TLS to secure all communications between their 
		servers and web browsers.
